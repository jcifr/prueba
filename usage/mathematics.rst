Integration
-----------

As the derivative of :math:`\sin x` is :math:`\cos x`,
and that of :math:`\cos x` is :math:`-\sin x`, we have

.. math::

   \int_{a}^{b}\cos x dx = \sin b - \sin a

   \int_{a}^{b}\sin x dx = \cos a - \cos b

Isn't that beautiful?

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
   \end{eqnarray}

.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

Euler's identity, equation :eq:`euler`, was elected one of the most
beautiful mathematical formulas.
